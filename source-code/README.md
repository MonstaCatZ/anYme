Good news, anYme is going Open Source and I need your help!

## Reasons

* Transparency
* Lack of time
* I want to make the switch to Kotlin, I like the syntax but there is still much I need to learn
* The original code in Java is a mess and _very_ verbose
* Faster development


## How can you help?

* Join the official Discord server here: https://discord.gg/8XtWsfX. All discussions will be done here. Not somewhere else.
* Check #open-source channel

* **Requirements:**
	* Must have experience with Android (Java + Kotlin)
	* Must have a SVN account on https://riouxsvn.com/account/
	* Must have made an Android app before
	* Must have at the 'Open Source' role in order to participate in the #open-source channel
	* Must have experience with the MAL API

## Code/App Consistency

For the sake of consistency, here are some basic rules (these will be updated soon)

* Follow all Java/Kotlin code conventions.
* The name of every Activity should end with Activity.
* The name of every Fragment should start with Fragment.
* Prefer self-explaining variable names.
* Prefer functionality over unit tests. Crashes will be analyzed using CrashLytics. anYme currently has 99.8% users who have never experienced a crash.
* Don't use Dependency Injection.
* Avoid ternary operators. It's okay if your code is 2 lines instead of 1.
* Use String templates when you want to include variables in a String.
* Always do null checks.
* Document your functions if they do not contain self-explaining variable names.
* The app should stay permissions free. You can't add permissions.
